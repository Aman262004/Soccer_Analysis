Soccer Analysis:

This application analyzes video clips from soccer matches to accurately distinguish and identify objects such as players, the ball, and referees. It utilizes the YOLOv8 object detection model, which will be enhanced by training with a dataset from Roboflow to improve its accuracy and performance.

Raw Input:

To begin the analysis, we first need to install the Ultralytics library and load the YOLOv8 model, specifically yolov8s. There are different versions of the model, such as yolov8m and yolov8x, where the letters 's', 'm', and 'x' represent the model's capabilities 's' for small, 'm' for medium, and 'x' for a more powerful model.

The choice of model depends on your PC’s specifications. Once the appropriate YOLO model is selected, we can run the object detection process. The model will detect objects in the video, drawing bounding boxes around them and assigning confidence scores.

It is important to note that all players and referees are classified as 'persons' by default. This is because the pre-trained YOLO model does not differentiate between different types of people, whether they are soccer players, basketball players, or referees—they are all identified simply as 'persons'.

Once you we run the model on the input video we will get the following output:
